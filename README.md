# Applied Statistical Methods used to analyze Kelly Blue Book data
This repository contains a final project from an Applied Statistical Methods class in college. I used various methods including regression and multiway ANOVA to analyze the data (contained in Cars.txt) and create predictive models. Included are a final project report with an appendix and the R code used
to create visualizations.
